    <p>Last updated: January 3, 2026</p>

    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time via the specific Stripe Customer Portal link available in your
        profile, or by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>As this is a digital product, <strong>we generally do not offer refunds</strong> once the service has been used.
    </p>
    <p>However, EU customers have the right to withdraw within 14 days if the service has not been fully performed. If
        you believe you have a valid reason, please contact us.</p>
